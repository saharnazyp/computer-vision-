# 🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks – Hands-On Practice with Keras

This repository / notebook is a structured, hands-on exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), focusing on understanding how computer vision models actually learn, not just how to run them.

The content follows a progressive learning path, where each section builds directly on the previous one.

## 📚 Covered Topics

The exercises include:

- **Convolutional Classifier**  
  Building a first CNN model from scratch using Keras.

- **Convolution & ReLU**  
  Understanding how convolutional layers extract features and why non-linearity matters.

- **Max Pooling**  
  Learning how spatial dimensionality is reduced while preserving important features.

- **Sliding Window (Stride & Padding)**  
  Exploring how stride and padding affect feature maps and receptive fields.

- **Custom Convnets**  
  Designing custom CNN architectures and experimenting with depth and filters.

- **Data Augmentation**  
  Improving model generalization by generating diverse training samples.

## 🎯 Learning Objective

The main goal of this project is conceptual clarity.

Instead of treating CNNs as black boxes, this notebook emphasizes:

- How architectural choices influence feature extraction  
- How spatial information flows through a network  
- Why certain design patterns are commonly used in computer vision models  

Accuracy matters — but understanding matters more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Image Data Pipelines & Augmentation  

## 🚀 Who This Is For

- Learners starting their journey in Computer Vision  
- Anyone who wants an intuitive understanding of CNNs  
- Practitioners revisiting fundamentals before building advanced models  

## 🧩 Notes

This project is intended for learning and experimentation.  
Code is written for readability and exploration rather than heavy optimization.
